title: "Kindle 3.1 First Look: Page Numbers!"
---

Some [neat news out of Amazon for Kindle owners today](http://www.kindlepost.com/2011/02/early-preview-of-free-software-update-for-kindle-.html):  
there's a software update coming soon which brings public notes, real page
numbers, a new layout for periodicals, and some new social features to the
device.  All this will be downloaded automatically when the update becomes
available soon, but the impatient can check it out now:  [you can download the
software update manually here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_navbox_top_kindlelg?nodeId=200529700).

Since the Kindle Daily Post's post was a little devoid of pictures, here's a few
to whet your appetite:

Page numbers and Kindle location numbers are now viewable by pressing the "Menu"
button:

Yes, this means that page and location numbers are hidden when you're reading.
The Kindle shows the progress bar (just like it used to), but now you only see
a percentage where you used to be able to view a location number at any time
while you're reading:

It's a little cleaner, and it's good if you want to focus on the content, but
it's not so great if you want to keep track of where you are in the book (if,
for example, you're reading non-Amazon content on multiple devices and can't use
Wispersync).  It's not a problem I have often, but I guess I'll see how I like
it once I've used it for a while.
