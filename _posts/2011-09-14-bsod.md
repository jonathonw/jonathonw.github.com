Behold, the famed Blue Screen of Death, reimagined for the "post-PC" era in
Windows 8:

Shiny.

All joking aside, this shows an attention to detail uncharacteristic of the
Microsoft of the past.  Sure, Microsoft has simplified the BSOD before (each
iteration of Windows shows less and less technical information on the BSOD
itself, leaving the technical stuff to the minidump and event log), but this is
this first iteration of Windows where they've tried to make the blue screen fit
in with the visual design of the rest of the system.
