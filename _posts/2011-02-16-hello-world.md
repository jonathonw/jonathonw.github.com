title: Hello World
---

Welcome!  I'm Jonathon, a graduate student studying Computer Science at <a
href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University</a>, and working as a
research assistant for the <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/"> Insitute
for Software Integrated Systems</a>. My research interests lie within mobile and
embedded computing; I'm currently a part of the AMMO project, working on the
core server components of our data-distribution system for mobile devices.

This site (Coding For Soup) is my personal blog--  here, I'll be posting about
pretty much anything that looks interesting, but, as far as technical topics go,
you'll probably see a lot of stuff about mobile computing and data distribution.
Enjoy!
